NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

He also killed travellers and guests, a violation of xenia, which fell under Zeus's domain. He took pleasure in these killings because they allowed him to maintain his iron-fisted rule.\r\n\r\nSisyphus and his brother Salmoneus were known to hate each other, and Sisyphus consulted with the Oracle of Delphi on just how to kill Salmoneus without incurring any severe consequences for himself. From Homer onward, Sisyphus was famed as the craftiest of men. He seduced Salmoneus's daughter Tyro in one of his plots to kill Salmoneus, only for Tyro to slay the children she bore by him when she discovered that Sisyphus was planning on eventually using them to dethrone her father.\r\n\r\nKing Sisyphus also betrayed one of Zeus' secrets by revealing the whereabouts of Aegina[8] (an Asopides who was taken away by Zeus) to her father (the river god Asopus) in return for causing a spring to flow on the Corinthian acropolis.[citation needed]"], ["price", 6.0], ["active", true], ["address", "copenhagen"], ["latitude", 55.6760968], ["longitude", 12.5683371], ["created_at", 2016-08-18 20:46:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-08-18 20:46:30 UTC], ["photo_file_name", "Brock-Lesnar-signs-WWE-extension.jpg"], ["photo_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["photo_file_size", 46358], ["photo_updated_at", 2016-08-18 20:46:29 UTC]]

Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".):
